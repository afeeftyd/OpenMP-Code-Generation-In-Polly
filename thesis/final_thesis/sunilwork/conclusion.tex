\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we defined tree insertion systems and showed that the generative power is the same as that of non deterministic
bottom-up tree automata (or equivalently regular tree grammars). By defining an extended system, the power slightly increases. 
It should be noted that the insertion definition given here is a restricted one with the inserted tree occupying lower levels only.
It may be interesting to widen the definition in such a way that a subtree is inserted in to a tree by cutting the tree at an internal node 
and inserting the subtree with the cut subtree attaching to a leaf of the inserted tree. Exploring the generative power of  such systems with different
contraints is being explored. 
\section{Future Work}

It would also be interesting to consider \emph{deletion system also}.
Also there are some applications for tree transducers in XML, since it has a tree structure.
