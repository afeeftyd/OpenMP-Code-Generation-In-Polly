  To check whether a top-down sequence in a tree is matching with
           left hand side of a production rule. 
            

  The function 'lhs' take a node sequence (in top-down manner) from the tree and check
   all the transition function to find a matching.  

 for(k = 0; k < n_of_items; k++)
    {
        root_array[k] -> visited = 1;

          Take a node and check all transitions in the file.
            

  If a match with a node, reset the root_array_gbl to start the operation and call function match
                    

  Copies the RHS of the matching transtion function with and without space
                        

  For each string in RHS call the function 'rhs' to process in the tree
                            
  If no match read the whole line so that we can search from next line again
