 lhs_leaf(*tfp,*gfp);
  The 'lhs_leaf' function processes the leaves of the tree.

   If a match with a node, reset the root_array_gbl to start the operation and call function match
                           

 match(root_array_gbl[i],*fp,2);

   Copies the first string from the LHS of the transition function
                               

  Search the root_array_temp for the matching LHS (first string) and replace it with corresponding RHS
                               

  To count how many words are there in the RHS of a production rule.
                                

  For each string in RHS call the function 'rhs' to process in the tree
                                   

   rhs(c);

  If no match read the whole line so that we can search from next line again
                           



 lhs_non_leaf(*tfp,*gfp);

    If a match with a node, reset the root_array_gbl to start the operation and call function match
                           

  Copies the RHS of the matching transtion function with and without space
                               

  Storing the data of previous match. 
                                                       

  Chech match again
                                                   


   If no match read the whole line so that we can search from next line again
                                                   

   Processing RHS


              Search the root_array_temp for the matching LHS (first string) and replace it with corresponding RHS
