\section{Introduction}

Today, effective polyhedral techniques exist to optimize computation intensive
programs.  Advanced data-locality optimizations are available to accelerate
sequential programs \cite{uday08pldi}. Effective methods to expose SIMD and
thread-level parallelism were developed and are used to offload calculations to
accelerators \cite{Baskaran10, Baghdadi_puttingautomatic}.  Polyhedral
techniques are even used to synthesize high-performance hardware
\cite{RISSET:2008}.
