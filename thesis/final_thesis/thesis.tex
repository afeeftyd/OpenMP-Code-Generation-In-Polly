\vspace*{24pt}

It is always a tedious task to manually analyze and detect parallelism in programs. When
we deal with autoparallelism the task becomes more complex. Frameworks such as OpenMP
is available through which we can manually annotate the code to realize parallelism and take the
advantage of underlying multi-core architecture. But the programmer's life becomes simple
when this is done automatically. In this report we present a framework for autoparallelism through Polly,
a project to enable polyhedral optimizations in LLVM and the work done
towards automatically generating OpenMP library calls for relevant parts of the code.

Various powerful polyhedral techniques exist to optimize
computation intensive programs effectively.  Applying these techniques on any
non-trivial
program is still surprisingly difficult and often not as effective as expected.
Most polyhedral tools are limited to a specific programming language.  Even for
this language, relevant code needs to match specific syntax that rarely
appears in existing code.  It is therefore hard or even impossible to
process existing programs automatically.  In addition, most tools target C or
OpenCL code, which prevents effective communication with compiler internal
optimizers. As a result target architecture specific optimizations are
either little effective or not approached at all.

 Polly automatically detects and transforms relevant program parts in a
language-independent and syntactically transparent way. Therefore, it supports
programs written in most common programming languages and constructs
like C++ iterators, goto based loops and pointer arithmetic.  Internally it
provides a state-of-the-art polyhedral library with full support for
$\mathbb{Z}$-polyhedra, advanced data dependency analysis and
support for external optimizers. Through LLVM, machine code for CPUs and GPU accelerators,
C source code and even hardware descriptions can be targeted.

\chapter{Various Tools Used in Polyhedral Community}
Some of the tools used in polyhedral community is described here with one example.
\section{ClooG}
CLooG is a free software and library generating loops for scanning Z-polyhedra.
It finds a code that reaches each integral point of one or more parameterized polyhedra.
CLooG has been written to solve the code generation problem for optimizing compilers based on the polytope model.

This is explained here with a simple example. Suppose we need to generate code for
a polyhedra with the following iteration domain.

\begin{center}
$D_{S}\ =\ \{(i,j)\ \epsilon\ Z^2\ |\ 2\ \leq\ i\ \leq\ 6\ \wedge\ 2\ \leq\ j\ \leq\ 6\ \wedge\ i\ \leq\ j\}$
\end{center}
We can give input to cloog as file which has the following format.
{\footnotesize
\begin{lstlisting}
# ---------------------- CONTEXT ------------------
c # language is C
# Context (constraints on two parameters)
2 4                   # 2 lines and 4 columns
# eq/in m  n  1   eq/in: 1 for >=0, 0 for =0
0   1  0 -6       # 1*m + 0*n -6*1 >= 0, i.e. m=6
0   0  1 -6       # 0*m + 1*n -6*1 >= 0, i.e. n=6
1 # We want to set manually the parameter names
m n                   # parameter names
# --------------------- STATEMENTS ----------------
1 # Number of statements
1 # First statement: one domain
# First domain
5 6                   # 5 lines and 6 columns
# eq/in i  j  m  n  1
1   1  0  0  0 -2 # i >= 2
1  -1  0  0  1  0 # i <= n
1   0  1  0  0 -2 # j >= 2
1   0 -1  1  0  0 # j <= m
1  -1  1  0  0  0 # n+2-i>=j
0  0  0               # for future options
1 # We want to set manually the iterator names
i j                   # iterator names
# --------------------- SCATTERING ---------------
0 # No scattering functions
\end{lstlisting}
}
Giving this file to 'cloog' command  as input it will generate the following code.
{\footnotesize
\begin{lstlisting}
/* Generated from ex1.cloog by CLooG 0.16.2 gmp bits in 0.00s. */
for (i=2;i<=6;i++) {
  for (j=i;j<=6;j++) {
    S1(i,j);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
}

\section{PLUTO}
PLUTO is an automatic parallelization tool based on the polyhedral model. The polyhedral model
for compiler optimization is a representation for programs that makes it convenient to perform
high-level transformations such as loop nest optimizations and loop parallelization. Pluto transforms
C programs from source to source for coarse-grained parallelism and data locality simultaneously.
The core transformation framework mainly works by finding affine transformations for efficient
tiling and fusion, but not limited to those.
Suppose we want to generate the tiled version of lu.c just issue the command
./polycc --tile lu.c
which will generate the output in a separate file called lu.tiled.c and displays
the following information
{\footnotesize
\begin{lstlisting}
[Pluto] Number of statements: 2
[Pluto] Total number of loops: 5
[Pluto] Number of deps: 10
[Pluto] Maximum domain dimensionality: 3
[Pluto] Number of parameters: 1
[Pluto] Affine transformations [<iter coeff's> <const>]
T(S1): (k, j, k)
3 3
 1  0  0 
 0  1  0 
 1  0  0 
T(S2): (k, j, i)
3 4
 1  0  0  0 
 0  0  1  0 
 0  1  0  0 
t1 --> fwd_dep  loop   (band 0)
t2 --> fwd_dep  loop   (band 0)
t3 --> fwd_dep  loop   (band 0)
[Pluto] Outermost tilable band: t0--t2
[Pluto] After tiling:
t1 --> fwd_dep  tLoop  (band 0)
t2 --> fwd_dep  tLoop  (band 0)
t3 --> fwd_dep  tLoop  (band 0)
t4 --> fwd_dep  loop   (band 0)
t5 --> fwd_dep  loop   (band 0)
t6 --> fwd_dep  loop   (band 0)
[Pluto] using Cloog -f/-l options: 4 6
[Polycc] Output written to ./lu.tiled.c
\end{lstlisting}
}
\section{VisualPolylib}
This is a tool using which we can visualize various operations on polyhedra. The polyhedral
description is given in a file and given as input to the 'visualpolylib' command.
For instance consider the following input
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/3d.eps}
  \caption{Visualizing polyhedra with VisualPolylib}
  \label{fig:3d}
\end{center}  
\end{figure}

{\footnotesize
\begin{lstlisting}
P :=   { i, j, k | k <= 1, k >= 0, i <= j, i+j >= k, i+4k <= 4j,j<=10};
C:={|};
CS := { i,j,k | i-2j+2k<=0};
P2 := CS . P;
initvisu(3,C)
\end{lstlisting}
}
The polyhedra for P2 which is the intersection of CS and P can be viewed graphically as in 
Figure ~\ref{fig:3d}
