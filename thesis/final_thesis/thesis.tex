\vspace*{24pt}

It is always a tedious task to manualy analyze and detect parallelism in programs. When
we deal with autoparallelism the task becomes more complex. Frameworks such as OpenMP
is available through which we can manually annotate the code to realize parallelism and take the
advantage of undelying multi-core architecture. But the programmer's life becomes simple
when this is done automatically. In this report we present a framework for autoparallelism through Polly,
a project to enable polyhedral optimizations in LLVM and the workdone
towards automatically generating OpenMP library calls for relevent parts of the code.

Various powerful polyhedral techniques exist to optimize
computation intensive programs effectively.  Applying these techniques on any
non-trivial
program is still surprisingly difficult and often not as effective as expected.
Most polyhedral tools are limited to a specific programming language.  Even for
this language, relevant code needs to match specific syntax that rarely
appears in existing code.  It is therefore hard or even impossible to
process existing programs automatically.  In addition, most tools target C or
OpenCL code, which prevents effective communication with compiler internal
optimizers. As a result target architecture specific optimizations are
either little effective or not approached at all.

 Polly automatically detects and transforms relevant program parts in a
language-independent and syntactically transparent way. Therefore, it supports
programs written in most common programming languages and constructs
like C++ iterators, goto based loops and pointer arithmetic.  Internally it
provides a state-of-the-art polyhedral library with full support for
$\mathbb{Z}$-polyhedra, advanced data dependency analysis and
support for external optimizers. Through LLVM, machine code for CPUs and GPU accelerators,
C source code and even hardware descriptions can be targeted.
