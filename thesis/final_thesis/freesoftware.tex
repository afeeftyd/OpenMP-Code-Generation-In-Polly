Doing Projects - The Free Software Way

Doing projects in free software world is always fun. More than fun this is a platform where
we experience the benefits of sharing knowledge. Here I would like to share some points 
regarding this in light of my experience with working in Polly.

One seeking for free software project should have an open mind. It is very difficult to
contribute for one who have fear in sharing their ideas and knowledge. There is no need for
such a fear since we will always get the ownership of our work. Only thing is that
others who are willing to contribute can freely update our code. There is no harm in
this approach. We are opening the doors for others and make the functionality
of our code better and in turn the quality of our product goes up.

This is a perfect platform for academic and student community to work. For a student to
make contributions to a project there should have good opportunities to learn the
current status of the work. This information is hidden in case of proprietry and closed software.
The proprietary approach will just provide some interfaces here and there to add a
new functionality. The student will not ever know about the project as a whole and
will never know where it is deployed.

What makes us qualified for contribuiting to a free software project? In fact the answer is
that we require only some basic qualification. Rest will be acquired by us when doing it.
The very first one would be some experience in basic build tools like an editor(vi, emacs, etc.),
make, gdb, etc, profficiency in one or two programming languages and ofcourse willingness to learn.
Almost all people in the community are ready to offer their helping hands to one who has this
basic qualification. Another prerequisite is to have good communication skills. That is expressing
yourself through media like mailing lists. And follow basic mailing list ethics(like avoiding
usage of short words ('d' for 'the')). 

The stepping stone for us is to convince the community that we have the basic qualifications discussed
above and make confidence about us in them. Here is a tip for this. Set up the environment yourself
and start to learn the code. You can seek help through the
mailing list at any time. If possible tackle a bug and try to fix that. Having done this you will
be in a position to add new features to the project. While we are implementing something and if we
are stuck somewhere always give a try to solve the problem ourselves and then seek help from
the developers with all your observations about the issue. This will boost up their confidence
in us and they will definitely help us. The reality is that the community needs more and more
people who are willing to contribute. They will never discourage us.

Once you became an active developer it is always good to review others code and post our comments
on it. Make sure that our code is reviewed by others also.
